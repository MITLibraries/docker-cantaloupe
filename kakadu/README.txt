This directory is for the kakadu source code. Since kakadu is proprietary,
this is something you need to get from Kakadu Software directly. When you
license the kakadu software from them, they will give you a Zip file. That
Zip file will have a directory in it that's named with your license key.
Copy that directory into this directory before you build this project to
enable your Docker container to be able to use the KakaduNativeProcessor.

You can license kakadu from Kakadu Software at http://kakadusoftware.com/
